#' Social Dominance Data Set
#'
#' In order to assess an individualâ€™s Social Dominance Orientation they were asked a series of questions about their views of Intergroup Dominance and Anti-Egalitarianism. Each of these questions had a score associated with if they agreed or disagreed and if that meant they had a high or low Social Dominance Orientation. These scores were later averaged and scaled 0 (low-SDO) to 1 (high-SDO). Additionally, this data was used to compare physical strength (Q1 - Q7) to SDO.
